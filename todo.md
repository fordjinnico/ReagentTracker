DO NOT READ THIS 
THIS IS VERY SECRET INTERNAL INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN BY USERS!!!

1. Consider grid settings for tracker window
2. Check performance issues after long farming session(I hope that some ultraoptimizing frame utilization helped with this but still need to check that)
3. Support for housing autoenabler? Idk if there are any need in this
4. Goal completion progress. Just keep it green or hide from tracker? Hide temporaly or hide at all by autodeselecting resource?
